# OOP labs
These are some laboratory works done during the course of Object Oriented Programming. I decided to explore its concepts by the use of javascript and a bit of typescript.

# Lab contents
lab1 - just a class, as an introduction into oop;

lab2 - an university management process via the terminal, which allows users to perform the following actions: 

    Faculty Operations:
    1. Create and assign a student to a faculty
    2. Graduate a student from a faculty
    3. Display current enrolled students
    4. Display graduates
    5. Check if a student belongs to a faculty
  
    General Operations:
    6. Create a new faculty
    7. Search which faculty a student belongs to
    8. Display University faculties
    9. Display faculties belonging to a field
lab3 - a terminal clone of Git, which allows users to manage the changes, status, general info and if there were any files deleted or added in a folder. Commits take place via snapshots;

lab4 - a deeper look into polymorphism and inheritance, by using 3 different implementations of stacks, linked through the same typescript interface.
